# ARQ_machanism
ARQ Principles Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) is an error-control mechanism for data transmission which uses acknowledgements (or negative acknowledgements) and timeouts to achieve reliable data transmission over an unreliable communication link. In an ARQ scheme, the receiver uses an error detection code, typically a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), to detect whether the received packet is in error. If no error is detected in the received data, the transmitter is notified by sending a positive acknowledgement. If an error is detected, the receiver discards the packet and sends a negative acknowledgement to the transmitter, and requests a re-transmission. An Acknowledgement (ACK) or Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) is a short message sent by the receiver to the transmitter to indicate whether it has correctly or incorrectly received a data packet, respectively. Timeout is a predetermined time interval after the sender sends the packet; if the sender does not receive an acknowledgement before the timeout, it usually re-transmits the packet until it receives an acknowledgement or exceeds a predefined number of re-transmissions.
